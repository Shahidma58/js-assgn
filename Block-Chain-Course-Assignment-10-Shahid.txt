Yes, filter is a highorder function because it needs a function as argument having logic to select the desired values. e.g. 

const data = [10, 11, 23, 45, 67, 8, 90, 42];

const result = data.filter(function(num){
    return (num % 2 === 0);
}); 

The function used to filter the values is passed as an argument to filter func.
